        <p>We are WECE, Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering, 
            a student organization at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
            dedicated to supporting women within the Illinois ECE department.
            We welcome members of all genders to be active in the group, and we strive to build
            communities amongst ourselves by hosting social, technical, and professional workshops!

        <header id="wece_header">About Spark</header>
        <p>WECE Spark began as an idea within the UIUC WECE Outreach committee and has 
            grown over the past two years into a full-fledged youth-centered website to introduce 
            young girls around the world to Computer and Electrical Engineering. Spark allows WECE 
            to help educate future engineers all over the country in parallel to our Outreach committee 
            hosting educational talks and events within the Champaign-Urbana community. Spark is a continuously 
            growing website based entirely on student contribution! Come help WECE and help fan the Spark for 
            young engineers!
